This repository contains software to implement the load (LOAD), addition (ADD), subtraction (SUB), division (DIV), multiplication (MULT), and optionally duplicate (DUBL) and swap (SWAP) instructions on architecture using 8 coprocessor registers (ST0-ST7) in the form of a stack.

This project is designed to compute functions of two arguments using the specified instructions and representing numbers in 754 format. Each instruction executes in one clock cycle.

Individual options:

Characteristics: 7
Mantis: 19
This repository provides an opportunity to explore and experiment with the specified instructions and coprocessor architecture for processing numbers in 754 format.
